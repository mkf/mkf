### Hi, I'm Mika

I am presently unemployed and residing in PoznaÅ„, no longer a student of AMU PoznaÅ„ nor of UMK(NCU) ToruÅ„, having dropped out.
        
See [my profile website](https://a.mikf.pl) for more information about me. There is also a [/now page](https://a.mikf.pl/now) there.

I maintain a mediocre wiki of mine at [wiki1.mikf.pl](https://wiki1.mikf.pl).

*My pronouns are __she/her__.*
