### Hi there 👋

My name is Mika Feiler.

I am presently unemployed and residing in Poznań, no longer a student of AMU Poznań nor of UMK(NCU) Toruń, having dropped out.
        
See [my profile website](https://a.mikf.pl) for more information about me. There is also a [/now page](https://a.mikf.pl/now) there.

I am active on Twitter as [@mika_feiler](https://twitter.com/mika_feiler).
