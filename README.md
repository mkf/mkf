### Hi there üëã

My name is Mika Feiler.

I am presently unemployed and residing in Pozna≈Ñ, no longer a student of AMU Pozna≈Ñ nor of UMK(NCU) Toru≈Ñ, having dropped out.
        
See [my profile website](https://a.mikf.pl) for more information about me. There is also a [/now page](https://a.mikf.pl/now) there.

I am active on Twitter as [@mika_feiler](https://twitter.com/mika_feiler).

Internships:
 * at DLabs/DiabetesLab, during 2016 and 2017 summer holidays,
 * at Pawe≈Ç Kapa≈Ça kapware.com, in August‚ÄìSeptember 2017.

Since high school times until the moving out to Pozna≈Ñ I was active in Scientific Circle of Computer Science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ, I was a regular attendee of Toru≈Ñ JUG and Allegro MeetIT Toru≈Ñ meetups, and I participated yearly in interactive exhibitions on the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science as part of Toru≈Ñ Festival of Art and Science.

I have an interest in functional programming. I use NixOS.

*My pronouns are __she/her__.* I used to be known as Micha≈Ç&nbsp;Krzysztof&nbsp;Feiler, and also as ArchieT (my previous username on GitHub, since abandoned and taken by someone else).
